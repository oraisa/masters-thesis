	abstract = {"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"-- Provided by publisher.}

@book{Cin11,
	abstract = {This text is an introduction to the modern theory and applications of probability and stochastics. The style and coverage is geared towards the theory of stochastic processes, but with some attention to the applications. In many instances the gist of the problem is introduced in practical, everyday language and then is made precise in mathematical form.   The first four chapters are on probability theory: measure and integration, probability spaces, conditional expectations, and the classical limit theorems. There follows chapters on martingales, Poisson random measures, Levy Processes, Brownian motion, and Markov Processes. Special attention is paid to Poisson random measures and their roles in regulating the excursions of Brownian motion and the jumps of Levy and Markov processes. Each chapter has a large number of varied examples and exercises.    The book is based on the author’s lecture notes in courses offered over the years at Princeton University. These courses attracted graduate students from engineering, economics, physics, computer sciences, and mathematics.   Erhan Çinlar has received many awards for excellence in teaching, including the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching at Princeton University. His research interests include theories of Markov processes, point processes, stochastic calculus, and stochastic flows. The book is full of insights and observations that only a lifetime researcher in probability can have, all told in a lucid yet precise style.},

	abstract = {We propose a new class of learning algorithms that combines variational approximation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Naive algorithms that use the variational approximation as proposal distribution can perform poorly because this approximation tends to underestimate the true variance and other features of the data. We solve this problem by introducing more sophisticated MCMC algorithms. One of these algorithms is a mixture of two MCMC kernels: a random walk Metropolis kernel and a block Metropolis-Hastings (MH) kernel with a variational approximation as proposal distribution. The MH kernel allows one to locate regions of high probability efficiently. The Metropolis kernel allows us to explore the vicinity of these regions. This algorithm outperforms variational approximations because it yields slightly better estimates of the mean and considerably better estimates of higher moments, such as covariances. It also outperforms standard MCMC algorithms because it locates the regions of high probability quickly, thus speeding up convergence. We also present an adaptive MCMC algorithm that iterates between improving the variational approximation and improving the MCMC approximation. We demonstrate the algorithms on the problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for logistic (sigmoid) belief networks.},

	abstract = {Concerns related to data security and confidentiality have been raised when applying machine learning to real-world applications. Differential privacy provides a principled and rigorous privacy guarantee for machine learning models. While it is common to inject noise to design a model satisfying a required differential-privacy property, it is generally hard to balance the trade-off between privacy and utility. We show that stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) – a class of scalable Bayesian posterior sampling algorithms – satisfies strong differential privacy, when carefully chosen stepsizes are employed. We develop theory on the performance of the proposed differentially-private SG-MCMC method. We conduct experiments to support our analysis, and show that a standard SG-MCMC sampler with minor modification can reach state-of-the-art performance in terms of both privacy and utility on Bayesian learning.}
