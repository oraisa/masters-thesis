\chapter{Background}

\section{Differential Privacy}

Differential privacy~\cite{DwR14} is a property of an algorithm that quantifies the 
amount of information about private data an adversary can gain from the 
publication of the algorithm's output.
The most commonly used definition uses two real numbers, 
\(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\) the quantify the information gain, or, from the 
perspective of the data subjects, the privacy loss of the algorithm.

The most common definition is called \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-DP, approximate DP 
or ADP~\cite{DwR14}.
The case where \(\delta = 0\) is commonly called \(\epsilon\)-DP or 
pure DP.

\begin{definition}\label{ADP-definition}
    An algorithm \(\calm\colon \calx \to \calu\) is \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-ADP if 
    for all neighbouring inputs \(x\in \calx\) and \(x'\in \calx\) and 
    all measurable sets \(S \subset \calu\)
    \[
        P(\calm(x)\in S) \leq e^\epsilon P(\calm(x')\in S) + \delta
    \]
\end{definition}

The neighbourhood relation in the definition is domain specific. With tabular 
data the most common definitions are the add/remove neighbourhood and 
substitute neighbourhood.
\begin{definition}
    Two tabular datasets are said to be add/remove neighbours if they are equal 
    after adding or removing at most one row to or from one of them. The datasets 
    are said to be in substitute neighbours if they are equal after 
    changing at most one row in one of them.
\end{definition}
The neighbourhood relation is denoted by \(\sim\). The definitions and 
theorems of this section are valid for all neighbourhood relations.

There many other definitions of differential privacy that are mostly used 
to compute \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-bounds for ADP. This thesis uses two of them: 
Rényi-DP (RDP)~\cite{Mironov17} and 
zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP)~\cite{BuS16}. Both are based 
on Rényi divergence~\cite{Mironov17}, which is a particular way of 
measuring the difference between random variables.

\begin{definition}
    For random variables with density or probability mass functions 
    \(P\) and \(Q\) the Rényi divergence of order 
    \(1 < \alpha < \infty\) is
    \[
        D_\alpha(P\dmid Q) = \frac{1}{\alpha - 1}\ln E_{x\sim Q}
        \left(\frac{P(x)^\alpha}{Q(y)^\alpha}\right)
    \]
    Orders \(\alpha = 1\) and \(\alpha = \infty\) are defined 
    by continuity:
    \[
        D_1(P\dmid Q) = \lim_{\alpha \to 1-} D_\alpha(P\dmid Q)
    \]
    \[
        D_\infty(P \dmid Q) = \lim_{\alpha\to \infty}D_\alpha(P\dmid Q)
    \]
\end{definition}

Both Rényi-DP and zCDP can be expressed as bounds on the 
Rényi divergence between the outputs of an algorithm with 
neighbouring inputs:

\begin{definition}
    An algorithm \(\calm\) is \((\alpha, \epsilon)\)-Rényi DP 
    if for all \(x \sim x'\)
    \[
        D_\alpha(\calm(x)\dmid \calm(x')) \leq \epsilon
    \]
    \(\calm\) is \(\rho\)-zCDP if for all \(\alpha > 1\)
    and all \(x \sim x'\)
    \[
        D_\alpha(\calm(x)\dmid \calm(x')) \leq \rho \alpha
    \]

\end{definition}

A very useful property of all of these definitions is composition~\cite{DwR14}: 
if algorithms \(\calm\) and \(\calm'\) are DP, the algorithm first computing 
\(\calm\) and then \(\calm'\), outputting both results, 
is also DP, although with worse bounds.
More precisely

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\calm\colon \calx \to \calu\) and 
    \(\calm'\colon \calx\times \calu \to \calu'\) be algorithms.
    Their composition is the algorithm outputting 
    \((\calm(x), \calm'(x, \calm(x)))\) for input \(x\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{composition-theorem}
    Let \(\calm\colon \calx \to \calu\) and 
    \(\calm\colon \calx\times \calu \to \calu'\) be algorithms. Then 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            If \(\calm\) is \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-ADP and 
            \(\calm'\) is \((\epsilon', \delta')\)-ADP, then 
            their composition is 
            \((\epsilon + \epsilon', \delta + \delta')\)-ADP~\cite{DwR14}
        \item 
            If \(\calm\) is \((\alpha, \epsilon)\)-RDP and 
            \(\calm'\) is \((\alpha, \epsilon')\)-RDP, then 
            their composition is \((\alpha, \epsilon + \epsilon')\)-RDP~\cite{Mironov17}
        \item 
            If \(\calm\) is \(\rho\)-zCDP and 
            \(\calm'\) is \(\rho'\)-zCDP, then 
            their composition is \((\rho + \rho')\)-zCDP~\cite{BuS16}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

All of the composition results can be extended to any number of compositions 
by induction. Note that any step of the composition can depend on the results 
of the previous steps, not only on the private data.

As any algorithm that does not use private data in any way is 
\((0, 0)\)-ADP, 0-zCDP and \((\alpha, 0)\)-RDP with all \(\alpha\), 
theorem~\ref{composition-theorem} has the following corollary, called 
post-processing immunity:

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(\calm\colon \calx\to \calu\) be an ADP, RDP or zCDP algorithm with 
    some privacy parameters. Let \(f\colon \calu\to \calu'\) be any algorithm 
    not using the private data. Then the composition of \(\calm\) and \(f\)
    is ADP, RDP or zCDP with the same privacy parameters.
\end{theorem}

There are many different DP algorithms that are commonly used, which are also
called mechanisms~\cite{DwR14}. This thesis only requires one of the most commonly 
used ones: the Gaussian mechanism~\cite{DwR14}.
\begin{definition}
    The Gaussian mechanism with parameter \(\sigma^2\) 
    is an algorithm that, with input \(x\), 
    outputs a sample from \(\caln(x, \sigma^2)\), where \(\caln\) denotes 
    the normal distribution.
\end{definition}

The RDP and zCDP bounds for the Gaussian 
mechanism are quite simple. The ADP bound is more complicated:

\begin{theorem}\label{gauss-DP-bounds}
    If for all inputs \(x\) and \(x'\), \(||x - x'||_2 \leq \Delta\),
    the Gaussian mechanism is 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            \((\alpha, \frac{\alpha \Delta^2}{2\sigma^2})\)-RDP~\cite{Mironov17}
        \item 
            \(\frac{\Delta^2}{2\sigma^2}\)-zCDP~\cite{BuS16}
        \item 
            \(n\) compositions of the Gaussian mechanism are 
            \((\epsilon, \delta(\epsilon))\)-ADP~\cite{Sommer2019} with 
            \[
                \delta(\epsilon) 
                = \frac{1}{2}\left(
                    \erfc\left(\frac{\sigma(\epsilon - n\mu)}{\sqrt{2n}\Delta}\right)
                    - e^\epsilon \erfc\left(\frac{\sigma(\epsilon + n\mu)}{\sqrt{2n}\Delta}\right)
                \right)
            \]
            where \(\mu = \frac{\Delta^2}{2\sigma^2}\) and \(\erfc\) is 
            the complementary error function.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The most common use case for the Gaussian mechanism is computing a 
function \(f\colon \calx \to \R\) of private data and feeding the result into 
the Gaussian mechanism to privately release the function value. 
The condition that the inputs 
of the Gaussian mechanism cannot vary too much leads into the concept of 
sensitivity of a function
\begin{definition}
    The \(l_p\)-sensitivity \(\Delta_p\), with neighbourhood relation \(\sim\),
    of a function \(f\colon \calx \to \R^n\)
    is 
    \[
        \Delta_p f = \sup_{x\sim x'}||f(x) - f(x')||_p
    \]
\end{definition}

Theorem \ref{gauss-DP-bounds} implies that the value of any function with 
finite \(l_2\)-sensitivity can be privately released using the Gaussian mechanism 
with appropriate noise variance \(\sigma^2\). Of course, the usefulness of the 
released value depends on the magnitude of \(\sigma^2\) compared to the actual 
value.
